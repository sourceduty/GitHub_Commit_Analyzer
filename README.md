> Concept software plan for GitHub to analyze repo commits and generate a detailed Commit Analysis Report for all of it's repos.

#

The goal is to develop a software tool that analyzes commit history across all repositories within a GitHub account and generates a comprehensive Commit Analysis Report. This report will provide insights into commit frequency, patterns, contributor activity, and overall repository health.

#
### Architecture

Data Collection:
- Utilize the GitHub API to fetch commit data for each repository. Authentication will be handled via personal access tokens to ensure secure access.
- The data collected will include commit hashes, commit messages, authors, timestamps, and file changes.

Data Storage:
- Store the fetched commit data in a structured database. Preferably, use a relational database like PostgreSQL to allow for complex queries and analysis.
- The database schema will include tables for repositories, commits, contributors, and file changes, each linked with appropriate foreign keys.

Data Processing:
- Implement data processing scripts to parse and clean the raw commit data. This includes normalizing commit messages, extracting key information, and handling edge cases like merge commits.
- Use batch processing to handle large volumes of commit data efficiently.

Analysis Engine:
- Develop an analysis engine to perform various analyses on the commit data. This includes:
  
- Commit Frequency Analysis: Calculate daily, weekly, and monthly commit frequencies for each repository.
- Contributor Analysis: Identify active contributors, their commit counts, and patterns of contribution over time.
- File Change Analysis: Determine which files are most frequently modified and the nature of these modifications (e.g., additions, deletions).

Report Generation:
- Design templates for the Commit Analysis Report. The report will include visualizations such as graphs and charts to represent commit frequencies, contributor activity, and file change patterns.
- Use a reporting library like ReportLab for generating PDF reports or a web-based framework like Flask/Django for generating interactive HTML reports.

User Interface:
- Develop a user interface that allows users to request and view Commit Analysis Reports. The UI will provide options to select specific repositories, date ranges, and types of analysis.
- Implement authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access and generate reports.

Automation and Scheduling:
- Implement a scheduling system to automate the generation of Commit Analysis Reports. Users can set up periodic reports (e.g., weekly, monthly) that are automatically generated and sent via email or available for download.

### Implementation Plan

1. Set up the development environment and configure access to the GitHub API.
2. Develop and test the data collection module to ensure accurate and complete data retrieval.
3. Design the database schema and implement data storage mechanisms.
4. Create data processing scripts and validate their performance on sample data sets.
5. Build the analysis engine and verify the accuracy of analyses through unit tests.
6. Design and develop the report generation module, including templates and visualizations.
7. Create the user interface and integrate it with the backend components.
8. Implement the scheduling system and configure automated report generation.
9. Conduct thorough testing and obtain feedback from potential users to refine the tool.
10. Deploy the software and provide user documentation and support.

By following this plan, the software tool will provide valuable insights into repository activity, helping users understand commit patterns, identify active contributors, and maintain healthy repositories.
